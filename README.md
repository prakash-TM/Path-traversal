# JavaScript Object Path traversal algorithm

### Algorithm for find path JSON object

* step 1: write function definition and get object and path string
 * step 2: split the path string and store into the new array as arr
 * step 3: assign object into new variable as res
 * step 4: use for loop and iterate the arr elements
 * step 5: check if res of arr element is defined or not
 * step 6: if not print undefined
 * step 7: if yes stored that object element into the res
 * step 8: finish the iteration print the res
